## Intent

Exploit hierarchical and temporal knowledge about a problem's solution
to reduce the state space for reasoning and learning.

## Motivation

Most approaches to reasoning and learning suffer from the problem of
*explosivity:* The space or time complexity grows polynomially or
exponentially in the number of states, making solutions for moderately
large state spaces impossible.  By structuring the problem in a
hierarchical manner it often becomes possible to avoid this
exponential growth.  For example, if a search space with 1000 nodes
can be searched with time complexity $O(n^3)$, the evaluation will
take $\sim 1,000,000,000$ units of time.  If the space can be
structured into a choice between 10 state spaces with 100 states each,
even this one level of hierarchy reduces the search to $\sim 1001000$
units or $0.1\%$ of the original search time.

## Applicability

This pattern is applicable whenever a hierarchical structure of the
problem can be identified and at least one of the desired solutions is
expressible in terms of the hierarchy.  Furthermore, either the
reasoner or learners used to solve the reasoning or learning problem
have to directly support hierarchical reasoning/learning, or the
decomposition of the problem and recombination of the solutions have
to be possible.
