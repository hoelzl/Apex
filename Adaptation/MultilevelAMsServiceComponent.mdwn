# Multilevel AMs Service Component

## Classification

[[!taglink adaptation]],
[[!taglink component]],
[[!taglink ascens/adaptation]],
[[!taglink edlc/adaptation]]

## Intent

The simple component is not able to self-adapt (or if the component is a proactive one its adaptation here is not enough). Thus adaptation in charge of an external AM. Here a single AM is not enough because each AM is in charge to manage higher level of information. The overall composite is made of a controlled SC and a part that manages the adaptation of the component. This latter part is composed by more that one AM: each of them is in charge of an higher level adaptation (hierarchy of adaptation).

## Context

This patterns has to be adopted when:

 -  there are components that need to be deployed in an environment
    where additional/different requirements necessitate the component
	to handle different sets of utilities and goals;

 -  there is the necessity to share knowledge or something else (e.g.
    code, hardware, etc.), that is better managed from an external
	controller;

 -  the problem can be tackled at different levels, so each AM is in
    charge of facing the same problem but at a different level, with
    higher level information.

## Structure

![Structure of the pattern](../Images/MultilevelAMsServiceComponent.png)

## Behavior

This pattern is designed around multiple explicit autonomic feedback
loops. The SC is managed by a hierarchy of AMs. Each AM perceives
information by the lower level (another AM or the component) and,
basing on these, it manages adaptation of all the lower levels in a
hierarchical way.

## SOTA Description

-   Goals: $G = \{G_{SC} \cup G_{AM1} \cup G_{AM2} \cup \dots \cup G_{AMn}\}$
-   Utilities: $U = \{U_{SC} \cup 
	  U_{AM1} \cup U_{AM2} \cup \dots \cup U_{AMn} \}$

## Consequences

The component can be a simple one because all the management of the
adaptation of its response to a service request is delegated to the
AMs. Adaptation is divided at different levels, based on the managed
information and on the capabilities of the AMs. Each added AM acts as
a Super AM (SAM) managing the system composed of the previous AMs and
the SC.
