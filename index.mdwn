# APEX: The ASCENS Pattern Explorer

The ASCENS project has identified a number of best practices that
support the development of ensembles.  APEX provides a hyperlinked
summary of some of these practices and patterns.

## Top 10 Best Practices

1.  Goal-oriented requirements engineering
2.  Use of languages that support dynamic adaptation as first-class concept 
3.  Performing qualitative and quantitative analysis
4.  Integrating local and global system aspects
5.  Adaptation based on control data
6.  Explicit representation of self-* objectives using a knowledge base
7.  Monitoring the system and the environment
8.  Reasoning and learning at runtime
9.  Development based on control feedback loops
10. Use of patterns at different levels of abstraction


## The Patterns

Good starting points to explore the pattern catalog are
[[AwarenessMechanism]] or [[StatisticalModelChecking]]

The following graphs shows the interdependencies between patterns.
