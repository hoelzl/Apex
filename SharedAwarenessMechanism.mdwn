# Shared Awareness Mechanism

## Specializes

[[AwarenessMechanism]]

## Classification

[[!taglink pattern/awareness]], [[!taglink pattern/conceptual]]

## Intent

Provide an [[AwarenessMechanism]] that is partially shared between
multiple members of an ensemble.

## Context

An [[AwarenessMechanism]] is an important element of many Service
Components (SCs) in an ensemble.  However, deep and broad awareness
requires significant resources for sensing, storing and processing
data.  If multiple SCs perform similar computations it may be more
efficient to share parts of the awareness mechanism.

## Description/Behavior

A Shared Awareness Mechanism is an awareness mechanism that can be
accessed by multiple Service Components (SCs).  It may me realized in
many ways: a traditional solution is to realize it as a service that
may be accessed by multiple SCs.  If the specific features of an
ensemble make this impractical, other realizations are possible.  For
example, agents may manipulate or leave markers in the environment to
store shared information without relying on non-local communication.
These stigmergic solutions are commonly found in biological systems
and also used in, e.g., swarm robotics where global communication
facilities are often not available.

## Consequences

Shared Awareness Mechanisms can provide awareness to multiple
components in a system without requiring the components to repeatedly
perform the necessary data gathering and calculations.  This reduces
the storage and computational resource requirements for individual
agents.  It also allows designers to exploit the property that
multiple agents relying on a shared awareness mechanism can be sure to
agree in their assessments of situations (at the same point in time).

Shared Awareness Mechanisms may be problematic in systems that rely on
slightly different behaviors for correct operation, or in scenarios
where Service Components with different internal models and
capabilities have to work together.  In the latter case, a
[[BlackBoardSystem]] may be more appropriate than sharing the complete
awareness mechanism.

## Applications

Shared Awareness Mechanisms are widely used in situation where simple
Service Components operate in an environment that requires awareness
of global properties.  For example, in the ASCENS rescue scenario, a
number of robots acts as landmarks that allow the rescue robots to
navigate to their targets.  This consititues a distributed awareness
mechanism where neither the landmarks nor the rescue robots have
global awareness of the system, but where the combination of the local
awareness of the landmarks about their immediate vicinity serves to
provide global awareness.
