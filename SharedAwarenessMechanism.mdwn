# Shared Awareness Mechanism

## Specializes

[[AwarenessMechanism]]

## Classification

[[!taglink pattern/awareness]], [[!taglink pattern/conceptual]]

## Intent

Provide an [[AwarenessMechanism]] that is partially shared between
multiple members of an ensemble.

## Context

An [[AwarenessMechanism]] is an important element of many Service
Components (SCs) in an ensemble.  However, deep and broad awareness
requires significant resources for sensing, storing and processing
data.  If multiple SCs perform similar computations it may be more
efficient to share parts of the awareness mechanism.
