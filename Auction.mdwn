## Specializes

## Classification

[[!taglink cooperation]], [[!taglink ensemble]], [[!taglink edlc/design]]

## Intent

Cooperation between agents with possibly diverging utility functions.

## Motivation

The distribution of tasks and resources among the components of an ensembles is a difficult problem.  One general solution mechanism is to collect bids for tasks and resources and to allocate them to the highest bidder.

## Applicability

Auctions are only applicable if agents can communicate reliably with each other and if agents have [Unique Identity].  In many cases, for example when business secrets are exchanged as part of the bid, [Secure Communication] between agents is necessary.

## Description/Behavior

There are many different variants of auctions.  For the time being, see [Wooldridge] or [Shoham and Leyton-Brown] for various auction mechanisms.
