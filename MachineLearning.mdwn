## Intent

Provide agents with faculties that allow them to learn from their
experience.

## Context

One important aspect of [[AwarenessMechanism]]s is the ability to
learn from previous experiences.  Machine learning techniques can be
usefully employed to support this.

## Description/Behavior

Machine learning techniques can roughly be classified into three
areas: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and
[[ReinforcementLearning]].

The supervised learning problem consists in generalizing from
experience: We have certain objects that we want to classify, e.g., by
assigning labels like "red bicycle" or "woman surfing in the sunset"
to images.  Furthermore we have a number of objects that are already
correctly labeled, the so-called training set.  In our example the
training set might be a number of pictures that have been manually
labeled.  A supervised learner would be passed the training images to
analyze and then be given the task of classifying unknown images,
i.e., classifying objects that don't appear in the training set.
Supervised learning techniques are useful for tasks such as image
recognition, speech recognition, or to provide function approximations
for other learning techniques.

Unsupervised learners are provided with a data set that provides no
labeled instances.  Their task is commonly to cluster the elements of
this data set according to their similarity.  These techniques can,
for example, be used to reduce the dimensionality of inputs to other
search, learning or reasoning problems.

An important class of learning problem for ensembles are
[[ReinforcementLearning]] tasks.  In this case the learner has to
learn a good *policy* for interacting with an environment, i.e., an
action for every state of the environment.  The feedback provided by
the environment consists of a state and a reward after each action.

## Consequences

Machine learning techniques are proving increasingly useful in a wide
variety of applications and are deployed in areas such as search
engines, voice recognition or behavior recognition.  However they are
typically computationally intensive and require large amounts of
training data, therefore they are not well suited to problems in which
training data is difficult to obtain.  Furthermore, most
machine-learning techniques are difficult to apply without significant
experience with the relevant methods.
